This repository is a collection of random EPUB examples I've put together for different purposes.

You can build the self-contained examples via the Ant script in the `examples` directory.  The `epub-slides` example takes a bit more explanation (to come) and builds an EPUB from [Slidy](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/Overview.html) slides.
